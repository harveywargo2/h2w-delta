# Open Directory 
These groups are a fundamental part of the UNIX-like foundation of macOS and are essential for system permissions and administration. 
You can view them using the dscl command in Terminal.

Open Directory in a Networked Environment
If a Mac is bound to an Open Directory Master or a different directory service like Microsoft Active Directory, dscl will show groups from the network directory in addition to the local ones. 
These groups are used to manage users and permissions across the entire network, providing centralized control over access to shared resources and services.


## Groups
admin: 
- This is the group for users who have administrative privileges on the machine. 
- Any user in this group can perform actions that require sudo or an administrator password. 
- The first user account created on a Mac is automatically added to this group.

staff: 
- This is the default primary group for all standard user accounts. 
- When a new user is created, their primary group is typically staff. 
- Files and folders created by users often have staff as their group owner.

wheel: 
- This is a very high-privilege group, often referred to as the "superuser" group. 
- On macOS, the only member of the wheel group is the root user. 
- In other UNIX systems, members of the wheel group might be granted the ability to use sudo, but on macOS, the admin group handles that.

daemon: 
- This group is for system services and background processes (daemons). 
- Daemons often run as specific users and belong to this group to manage their permissions.

_lpadmin: 
- This group is for users who have permission to administer printers. 
- Users in this group can add, delete, and manage print queues.

_lpoperator: 
- This group allows users to operate print queues (e.g., cancel jobs) but not to manage the printers themselves.

_appserveradm: 
- Used for administration of application server services.

everyone: 
- A special group that includes every user on the system. 
- It's often used for setting permissions that apply to anyone, regardless of their user account.
